<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The purpose of this project is to design and implement a song popularity predictor. The goal is to determine if the chance of a song becoming a hit can be calculated using regression neural networks. Examples of song features that could be considered include song genre, tempo, and loudness. For training the network, both a custom-made dataset and a dataset called Spotify_Features pulled from an online source will be considered. There are countless aspects that play into the success rate of a song, such as language or artist location; however, due to limitations, we are investigating if we can remove low-impact features without noticeably affecting prediction accuracy. A song popularity predictor would give artists, record labels, and producers an estimated success rate of their song solely based on original characteristics of the audio itself.

### Built With

* [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/)
* [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

First, fork the repository [here](https://github.com/cadegw1/song-popularity-predictor). If you plan to run the program with anaconda then please skip to the [Anaconda Setup](#anaconda-setup).

### Prerequisites
A spotify developer account is required and can be created [here](https://developer.spotify.com/).
1. In the dashboard, create a new app.

2. Copy the 'Client Id' and 'Client Secret'.

3. Create two environment variables called 'SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID' and 'SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET' containing the copied values of 'Client Id' and 'Client Secret'.


### Installation

1. All packages can be installed using pip. Links to packages used can be found [here](#built-with)


<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


### Anaconda Setup
An environment.yml file has been provided for anaconda implementation.
1. Follow steps 1 and 2 in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) to obtain a 'Client Id' and 'Client Secret'.

2. In the environment.yml file, paste the copied values in the variables section
```yml
variables:
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID:
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET:
```

3. Create a new anaconda env using the environment.yml
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

4. Activate the anaconda env
```sh
conda activate csc4444_SemProj
```

For more in-depth instructions using anaconda please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This is a conceptual implementation of how to predict a songs popularity using Spotify features. Examples of real world use would be a producer or artist estimating their songs predicted popularity.
